# Plan feature

## When to use

Use this skill when the user asks to create a detailed, actionable plan for implementing a feature in the GitHub Copilot Chat workspace.

## Instructions

- Always read the documentation in the `.github/docs` folder, if it exists, to understand how the app looks and works before starting a plan.
- Match the app's existing code patterns and data flow when designing the plan.
- For frontend features that depend on a backend, ask about existing backend endpoints and their contracts (route, method, request/response shape, auth).
- If no backend endpoint exists, propose a clear API contract: route, HTTP method, request/response JSON examples, validation rules, and auth requirements.
- Include acceptance criteria and a minimal verification plan (how to test manually or with automated tests).
- List the specific files, components, and tests that need changes so a junior developer can implement them.
- Keep steps small, numbered, and actionable.
- When using placeholder output or mock endpoints, state exactly where the data ends up and what the backend must provide to make the feature production-ready.

## Output format

-- Add a `##` heading for the feature in `planning/features.md` using the feature name.

- Under the heading include:
  - Short description of the feature.
  - Acceptance criteria.
  - Files to change (paths).
  - Proposed API contract (if applicable) with request/response examples.
  - Step-by-step implementation list with small tasks.
  - Testing / verification steps and suggested reviewers.
  - Rough effort estimate (small / medium / large or hours).
- Ensure the plan's steps are small and actionable for a junior developer.

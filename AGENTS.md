# Agent Instructions

## Project Context

- This is a learning project for a junior developer
- Prioritize simple, readable code over clever solutions
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Always read the documentation in the docs folder to understand how this app works before each implementation
- Always implement code one section at a time - and ask me if you need more input or context. Rather do too small steps than too big

## Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript strictly (no `any` unless necessary)
- Tailwind for all styling (no custom CSS)
- Server components by default, "use client" only when needed
- Use DRY (Don't repeat yourself) as much as possible
- Use comments to explain the code (docstrings on functions and single line comments on complex code sections). Explain it so a junior developer with less than one year of experience can understand.
- Update the relevant documentation in the docs folder after each implementation, if necessary

## Preferences

- I prefer NextJS over separate Express backend
- I like iterative development (get basics working first)
- Explain trade-offs when there are multiple approaches
- Please only speak english, even if the codebase contains comments in another language
- Do not automatically add solutions for "new" and "legacy" models if models change. Always create code solutions for the existing models and let the user know some legacy documents maybe won't work.
